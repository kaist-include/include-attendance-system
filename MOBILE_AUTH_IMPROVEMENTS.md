# Mobile Authentication Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to fix authentication persistence issues on mobile web browsers, particularly Safari and other mobile browsers that have restrictive storage policies.

## Problem

Mobile browsers (especially Safari on iOS) have stricter policies around localStorage and sessionStorage:
- Private browsing mode blocks localStorage
- Cross-site tracking prevention can clear storage
- App-like browsing modes may have different storage behaviors
- Cookie policies are more restrictive

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Client-Side Cookie Storage

**File: `src/utils/supabase/client.ts`**

- Added explicit cookie storage configuration
- Implemented mobile-friendly cookie options:
  - `sameSite: 'lax'` for cross-site compatibility
  - `secure: true` for HTTPS (production)
  - `maxAge: 7 days` for reasonable persistence
  - `path: '/'` for site-wide access
- Added localStorage fallback mechanism:
  - Primary: localStorage (when available)
  - Fallback: Cookies (when localStorage fails)

### 2. Enhanced Middleware Cookie Handling

**File: `src/utils/supabase/middleware.ts`**

- Updated cookie options for mobile compatibility
- Consistent cookie settings across all auth flows
- Proper `httpOnly: false` to allow client-side access

### 3. Enhanced Server Client Cookie Handling

**File: `src/utils/supabase/server.ts`**

- Matching cookie options for consistency
- Environment-aware security settings

### 4. Enhanced Authentication Hook

**File: `src/hooks/useAuth.tsx`**

- Added mobile device detection
- Enhanced logging for mobile auth debugging
- Better error reporting for mobile-specific issues

### 5. Mobile Auth Debug Endpoint

**File: `src/app/api/debug/mobile-auth/route.ts`**

- Provides detailed debugging information
- Checks cookie storage status
- Offers recommendations for fixing auth issues

## Testing Mobile Authentication

### 1. Debug Endpoint

Visit `/api/debug/mobile-auth` on your mobile device to check:
- Authentication status
- Cookie storage
- Mobile device detection
- Recommendations for fixing issues

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test on Multiple Mobile Browsers:**
   - Safari (iOS)
   - Chrome (Android/iOS)
   - Firefox Mobile
   - Samsung Internet

2. **Test Different Scenarios:**
   - Normal browsing mode
   - Private/Incognito mode
   - App-like mode (add to home screen)
   - After clearing browser data

3. **Test Authentication Flow:**
   ```
   1. Log in on mobile device
   2. Close browser completely
   3. Reopen browser
   4. Navigate to app
   5. Verify user is still logged in
   ```

### 3. Console Debugging

On mobile devices, check the browser console for:
- Mobile device detection messages
- Storage availability warnings
- Cookie count information
- Auth state change events

## Key Features

### Cookie Storage Configuration

```typescript
{
  path: '/',
  maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7, // 7 days
  sameSite: 'lax',
  secure: window.location.protocol === 'https:',
  httpOnly: false // Required for client access
}
```

### Storage Fallback System

```typescript
// Primary: localStorage
localStorage.setItem(key, value)

// Fallback: cookies
document.cookie = `${key}=${value}; Path=/; Max-Age=604800; SameSite=lax`
```

## Mobile-Specific Considerations

1. **Safari iOS:**
   - Requires `sameSite: 'lax'` for proper functionality
   - Private browsing blocks localStorage completely
   - Needs explicit cookie configuration

2. **Chrome Mobile:**
   - Generally more permissive
   - Still benefits from explicit cookie settings

3. **Cross-Site Tracking Prevention:**
   - Modern mobile browsers block third-party cookies
   - First-party cookies (our domain) should work fine

## Troubleshooting

### User Reports "Logged Out on Mobile"

1. Check `/api/debug/mobile-auth` for diagnostic info
2. Verify HTTPS is enabled in production
3. Check if user is in private browsing mode
4. Ask user to try clearing browser cache and logging in again

### No Authentication Cookies Found

1. Verify domain settings are correct
2. Check that `secure` flag matches protocol (HTTP vs HTTPS)
3. Ensure `sameSite` is set to 'lax' or 'none'

### Session Exists But No User

1. Token refresh issue - user should log out and back in
2. Check server-side cookie configuration
3. Verify middleware is properly configured

## Production Deployment Notes

1. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for secure cookies)
2. Verify domain configuration matches production URL
3. Test with actual mobile devices, not just desktop browser mobile mode
4. Monitor authentication success rates after deployment
